Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start  
Runs the app in development mode.  
Opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser.  
The page reloads on changes. Lint errors appear in the console.

npm test  
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build  
Builds the app for production in the build folder.  
Optimizes and minifies the build. The output is ready to deploy.

npm run eject  
Removes the single build dependency from the project and exposes all configuration files (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).  
This operation is irreversible.

You are not required to eject. The default setup supports many use cases.
